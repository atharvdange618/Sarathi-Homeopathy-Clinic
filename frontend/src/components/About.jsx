                <p className="mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto">So why Homeopathy? Homeopathic medicine facilitates the body's physical and emotional recovery without causing more damage to the body. Your body is yours to be responsible for. If you eat food that is not fresh, you will have a stomach ache. If you drink too much, you will have a burning in your liver. These are all warning signs that your body does not like what is happening to it. A homeopath considers the whole picture and thus does not treat physical, emotional and mental symptoms separately, but takes the view that they are all interconnected as facets of the patient's suffering. This is what makes homeopathy a truly holistic and refined art.</p>
